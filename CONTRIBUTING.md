## Use Git Flow

Merge requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your merge requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the tests pass. 
4. Make sure your code lints. 
6. Merge request to `develop`, not to main.
